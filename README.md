# dog_breed_classifier
This is a classifier to predict the breed of a dog. It will be used in a dog competition to check if the animal participating in the competition is a dog or not. 
The competition requires the contestants to attach a picture of their dog on the online registration form. These pictures will be collected and stored in a dataset. The classifier will predict if the pictures in this dataset are dogs or not. The contestants who are classified as 'not dogs' will be removed from the competition after further review.
